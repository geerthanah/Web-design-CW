			<h3> Steve Jobs </h3>
			<br>
			<div class="books">
				<img src="../student2_images/steve_bio.jpg" alt="book1">
				
				<h5><i> Summary </i></h5>
				<br>
				<p>Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography of American business magnate 
				and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The book was written at the request of Jobs by 
				Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and TIME who had previously written 
				best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. 
				Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—in addition 
				to interviews with more than one hundred family members, friends, adversaries, 
				competitors, and colleagues—Isaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life. 
				Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak honestly. Although Jobs 
				cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over its content other than the book's cover, 
				and waived the right to read it before it was published.] Describing his writing, Issacson commented 
				that he had striven to take a balanced view of his subject that did not sugarcoat Jobs's flaws. 
				The book was released on October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days after Jobs's death.

			<h3> Washington: A Life </h3>

			<div class="books">
				<img src="../student2_images/washington_bio.jpg" alt="book4">
				
				<h5><i> Summary </i></h5>
				<br>
				<p>Washington: A Life is a biography of George Washington, the first president of the 
				United States, written by American historian and biographer Ron Chernow and published 
				in 2010. The book is a "one-volume, cradle-to-grave narrative" that attempts to provide 
				a fresh portrait of Washington as "real, credible, and charismatic in the same way he was 
				perceived by his contemporaries".
				Chernow, a former business journalist, was inspired to write the book while researching 
				another biography on Washington's long-time aide Alexander Hamilton. Washington: A Life 
				took six years to complete and makes extensive use of archival evidence. The book was 
				released to wide acclaim from critics, several of whom called it the best biography of 
				Washington ever written. In 2011, the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, 
				as well as the New-York Historical Society's American History Book Prize.
